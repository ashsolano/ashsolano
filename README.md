# Hi, I'm Ashleigh Solano! 👋

I'm a PhD student at the University of Melbourne, School of Physics, specializing in Cellular Biophysics. I'm passionate about studying protein spatiotemporal dynamics using live cell microscopy techniques and developing tools using FCS (Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy).

🔬🧬🌱📊

- 🔬 I'm interested in cellular biophysics, protein dynamics, live cell microscopy, and data analysis.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python and working on developing FCS tools for analyzing protein oligomer spatiotemporal dynamics in live cells.
- 🧬 I'm part of the Cellular Biophysics Group at the University of Melbourne.
- 💡 I'm interested in innovative approaches to studying protein dynamics and its applications in understanding cellular processes at a single cell level.
- 📊 I'm enthusiastic about data analysis, visualization, and interpreting complex biological datasets.
